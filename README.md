## Quick Start

This project uses **pnpm** for dependency management (faster and more efficient than npm).

```bash
# Install pnpm globally (if not already installed)
npm install -g pnpm

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run development server
pnpm run serve

# Build for production
pnpm run build

# Start production server
pnpm run start
```

See [PNPM Migration Guide](docs/PNPM_MIGRATION.md) for more details on why we use pnpm and how to work with it.
